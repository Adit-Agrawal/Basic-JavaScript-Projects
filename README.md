# Basic-JavaScript-Projects

- I created many of these projects while learning the fundamentals of JavaScript, as a way to put that knowledge into practice.
- Some were built later when, after spending a lot of time with React, I realized I had become a bit rusty with the core JavaScript concepts—so I revisited them by working on these Vanilla JS projects.
- A few of these aren’t full-fledged projects but rather small exercises or concept demos. I uploaded them here as a way to track my progress and remind myself of where I started.


# Everyone begins somewhere—and this is where I began.
