## Product Data Structure

Each product object contains:
```javascript
{
  id: String,           // Unique identifier
  title: String,        // Product name
  company: String,      // Brand/company name

  price: String         // Price with comma formatting
}
```

## Getting Started

4. Open `index.html` in your web browser

### Running the Project

#### Option 1: Local Server (Recommended)
```bash

python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP (if available)
php -S localhost:8000

## Usage

### Text Search
1. **Search Products**: Type in the search input to filter products by name
2. **Real-time Results**: Products filter automatically as you type
