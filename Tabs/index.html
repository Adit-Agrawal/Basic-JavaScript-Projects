                Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, 
                Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Disagreements, especially over student selection, led to Slytherin's departure. 
                The school has since become the premier institution for magical education in Britain, surviving wars, dark wizards, and countless secrets.
